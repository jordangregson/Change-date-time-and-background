# changedatetimeandbackground
That is a long name, but it explains what the program does. I'll come up with a shorter name in the future. This is a web app that allows the user to press a button. Upon pressing the button, the date and time will be displayed, and the background will change to match the colors that might be outside. Press the refresh button to reload everything, because the "Click Here" button can only be pressed once (I'm still working on that).
